## ELinks 0.11.CVS configuration file

## This is ELinks configuration file. You can edit it manually,
## if you wish so, but keep in mind that this file is overwritten
## by ELinks when you save options through UI and you are out of
## luck with your formatting and own comments then, so beware.
##
## Obviously, if you don't like what ELinks is going to do with
## this file, you can change it by altering the config.saving_style
## option. Come on, aren't we friendly guys after all?

#  Configuration handling options.
