Methods
-------

do_file(path)

   Load and evaluate the file with the given path (string). For example:

      do_file("/home/me/.elinks/hooks.js");

   will reload your hooks file.


elinks.alert(message)

   Display the given message (string) in a message box. For example:

      elinks.alert("Hello, world!");

   will display a friendly greeting.


elinks.execute(command)

   Execute the given command (string) on the current terminal. For example:

      var quoted_uri = "'" + elinks.location.replace(/'/g, "'\\''") + "'";
      elinks.execute("firefox " + quoted_uri);

   will run Firefox with the URI of the current document.

   Note: one must be very careful with elinks.execute, because depending
   on the OS, the command may be subject to interpretation by a command shell
   language. When constructing the command string, be sure to quote any
   dubious parts (such as the URI of the current document, as above).


elinks.load_uri(uri, callback)

   Load the given URI (string). When the URI completes loading, ELinks calls
   the given callback (function). The callback is passed the cache object
   that corresponds to the URI. For example:

     elinks.load_uri("http://www.eldar.org/cgi-bin/fortune.pl?text_format=yes",
                     function (cached) { elinks.alert(cached.content); });

   displays a fortune.

   The cache object will not expire until after the callback returns.


Properties
----------

elinks.home (string)

   ELinks's 'home' directory, where it stores its configuration files.
   Read-only. For example,

      do_file(elinks.home + "hooks.js");

   will reload your hooks file.


elinks.location (string)

   The URI of the currently open document. This can be read to get a string
   with the URI or set to load a different document. For example,

      elinks.location = elinks.location + "/..";

   will go up a directory (if the URI doesn't end in a file).


elinks.bookmarks (hash)

   This is a hash, the elements of which correspond to the bookmarks.
   One can delve into the bookmarks hierarchy in a reasonably nifty
   fashion, just by using standard ECMAScript syntax:

      elinks.bookmarks.x.children.y.children.z.children.foo.title

   gets the title of the bookmark titled 'foo' under the folder 'z',
   which is a subfolder of 'y', which is a subfolder of 'x'.

   A bookmark object has these properties:

   item.title (string)

      This is the title of the bookmark. It can be read and set.

   item.url (string)

      This is the URI of the bookmark. It can be read and set.

   item.children (hash)

      This is a hash, the elements of which are the bookmarks that
      are children to the item. It is read-only.


elinks.globhist (hash)

   This is a hash, the elements of which correspond to entries in ELinks's
   global history. The hash is indexed by URI. For example,

      elinks.globhist["file:///"]

   will get you the history item for your root directory.

   A history item has these properties:

   item.title (string)

      This is the title of the history item. It can be read and set.

   item.url (string)

      This is the URI of the history item. It can be read and set.

   item.last_visit (number)

      This is the UNIX time of the last visit time for the item. UNIX time
      is the number of seconds that have passed between the UNIX epoch (which
      is 1970-01-01 00:00:00 UTC) and the represented time. Note that this is
      _seconds_ since the epoch, whereas ECMAScript likes to use _milliseconds_
      since the epoch. This property can be set or read.


elinks.keybinding (hash)

   This is a hash, the elements of which correspond to ELinks's keymaps.
   Currently, there are three: elinks.keybinding.main, elinks.keybinding.edit,
   and elinks.keybinding.menu. These elements are also hashes, the elements of
   which correspond to bindings. For example, elinks.keymaps.main["q"] is
   the binding to the 'q' key in the main map. These bindings can be red,
   to get the name of the action to which the key is bound, or set, either
   to a string with the name of the ELinks action or to a function, which will
   thenceforth be called when the key is pressed. For example,

      elinks.keymaps.main["!"] = function () { elinks.alert("Hello!"); }

   binds the '!' key in the main map to a function that displays a friendly
   alert.

      elinks.keymaps.main["/"] = "search-typeahead-text";

   changes the '/' key to use the nice typeahead search function instead of
   opening that ugly old search dialogue box.


Hooks
-----

These are actually properties, but a special case: one assigns functions
to them, which functions are called at certain events.

Note that the default hooks file assigns functions that provide a mechanism
to register multiple functions to each hook. When these default hooks are
called, they iterate over all functions that are registered to them, calling
each one in serial.

If you want to register a preformat_html hook, for example,
the preferred way to do so is not this:

   elinks.preformat_html = foo;

but rather this:

   elinks.preformat_html_hooks.push(foo);

which adds foo to an array of functions, over which the default
elinks.preformat_html function will iterate.

If any function in that array returns false, the default hook
will stop iteration, not calling any more handlers. This applies
to all of the default hooks.


elinks.preformat_html(cached, vs)

   This function is called every time a document is loaded, before the document
   is actually rendered, to give scripts the opportunity to modify it. The
   first parameter is the cache object and the second is the view_state object
   (documented below). As explained above, it is preferred to add your hook
   to elinks.preformat_html_hooks rather than to assign it to
   elinks.preformat_html.

   The cache object will not expire until after this function returns.


elinks.goto_url_hook(url)

   This function is called every time the user enters something
   in the Go to URL box. The url (string) can be modified or not,
   and the returned string is substituted for what the user entered.
   If the value false is returned, the URL is not changed and further hooks
   in ELinks are not run. As explained above, it is preferred to add your hook
   to elinks.goto_url_hooks rather than to assign it to elinks.goto_url_hook.


elinks.follow_url_hook(url)

   This function is called every time the user tries to load a document,
   whether by following a link, by entering a URI in the Go to URL box,
   by setting elinks.location, or whatever. It behaves the same as
   elinks.goto_url_hook above. As explained above, it is preferred to add your
   hook to elinks.follow_url_hooks rather than to assign it to
   elinks.follow_url_hook.

Other Objects
-------------

cache

  The cache object mentioned in the descriptions of elinks.load_uri and
  elinks.preformat_html is a wrapper for the internal ELinks cache object.
  ELinks passes the ECMAScript cache object as an argument to your
  ECMAScript function, and keeps the corresponding document in the
  cache until the function returns. After that, ELinks may remove the
  document from the cache, even if the function has saved the cache
  object to some global variable. Such an expired cache object does
  not work but it does not crash ELinks either.

  The properties of the cache object are:

  cached.content (string)

     This is the content received from the server. It can be read and set.

  cached.type (string)

     This is the MIME type of the cache entry. It can be read and set.

  cached.length (number)

     This is the length of cached.content. It is read-only.

  cached.head (string)

     This is the header received from the server. It can be read and set.

  cached.uri (string)

     This is the URI of the cache entry. It is read-only.

view_state

   The view_state object mentioned in the description of elinks.preformat_html
   is a wrapper for the internal ELinks view_state object. The view state holds
   information on how the current document is being displayed.

   vs.plain (boolean)

      Whether the current document is rendered as HTML or displayed
      as plaintext. This can be read and set.

   vs.uri (string)

      This is the URI of the current document. It is read-only.
