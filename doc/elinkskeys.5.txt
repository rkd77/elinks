:Description:	ELinks keybindings

NAME
----
elinkskeys - keybindings for ELinks

SYNOPSIS
--------
Information on how to configure keybinding and overview of the default
keybindings.

DESCRIPTION
-----------

Key binding for elinks should be placed in the file `~/.elinks/elinks.conf`.
Note that any information regarding their format/structure may not be
up-to-date. If you will discover that, please feed us with a patch.

Key binding statements are of the form:

	bind <keymap> <keystroke> = <action>

where:

<keymap>::

	is 'main', 'edit', or 'menu'.  The main keymap is used for general
	browsing.  The edit keymap is used for editing text fields.  The menu
	keymap is used for navigating menus.

<keystroke>::

	is a case sensitive key, which you can prefix with 'Ctrl-', 'Alt-',
	or both.  'Ctrl-' must be followed by an uppercase key. See below for
	a list of valid keys.

<action>::

	is what the key should do. The actions available are dependent on the
	keymap, and are listed separately below.

All words/strings may all be quoted "like so". Backslashes are escape
characters, even if not between quotes.	Lines beginning with a hash character
(`#`) are comments.

Keys can be unbound just by binding them to the special 'none' action. It may
be of use if you accidentally type a key often.

EXAMPLE BINDINGS
----------------

Some sample keybindings:

	bind "main" "v" = "view-image"
	bind "main" "l" = "jump-to-link"
	bind "main" "L" = "link-menu"
	bind "main" "F10" = "file-menu"
	bind "main" "F9" = "menu"
	bind "main" "Escape" = "menu"
	bind "edit" "Ctrl-R" = "auto-complete-unambiguous"
	bind "edit" "Ctrl-W" = "auto-complete"
	bind "edit" "Ctrl-K" = "kill-to-eol"
	bind "menu" "Ctrl-B" = "page-up"
	bind "menu" "PageUp" = "page-up"
	bind "menu" "Ctrl-F" = "page-down"
	bind "menu" "PageDown" = "page-down"
	# ELinks with Lua support
	bind "main" ","	= "lua-console"

KEYS
----

Valid keys are: alphanumeric characters, punctuation, 'Enter', 'Backspace',
'Tab', 'Escape', 'Left', 'Right', 'Up', 'Down', 'Insert', 'Delete', 'Home',
'End', 'PageUp', 'PageDown', 'F1' to 'F12'.

Some keys will need to be quoted or escaped. For example, space can be written
as  `" "` (quote space quote), and the quote itself as `\"` (backslash quote).
Backslash can be written as `\\` (double backslash).

/////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
FIXME:

 - You may prefix each of these keys with a number, telling its repeat count
  (how many times to do it). You can also re-bind keys, see elinkskeys(5) for
  documentation and a more complete list of keys  bound by default. 

 - The following keys can be used while editing a line/jumping to a URL
