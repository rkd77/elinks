Getting ELinks up and running
-----------------------------

Installing ELinks should be pretty easy on most systems. Below is described
the whole process of configuring the compilation, compiling and installing.

Building and Installing ELinks
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The quick guide for the impatient. Issue the following commands from the
ELinks source directory:

	$ ./configure && make && make install

However you might consider to tweek a few compile time options before building
ELinks. You might also want to take a look at what libraries and programs are
required or recommended that you install.

Requirements
~~~~~~~~~~~~

To successfully install ELinks all that is required is GNU make
(version 3.78 or later) and a C compiler. If you want to install
directly from GIT it is also required that automake and autoconf
is installed on your system.

Recommended Libraries and Programs
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To make use of many of ELinks features you will need to have some external
libraries and utility programs installed on your system. It is recommended to
have the following libraries and programs installed:

_____________________________________________________________________________

When compiling, you also need the header files for the libraries. Most OS
distributors put a given library's headers in a package separate from the
library itself; this package usually has `-dev` or similar appended to its
name.

Further reading
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This installation guide is far from being complete. You are also advised to
read the `README` and the `INSTALL` files distributed with ELinks for further
up to date info on building and installing.
