NAME
----
elinks - lynx-like alternative character mode WWW browser

SYNOPSIS
--------
'elinks' [OPTION]... [URL]...

DESCRIPTION
-----------

'ELinks' is a text mode WWW browser, supporting colors, table rendering,
background downloading, menu driven configuration interface, tabbed browsing
and slim code. 

Frames are supported. You can have different file formats associated with
external viewers. `mailto:` and `telnet:` are supported via external clients.

ELinks  can handle both local files and remote URLs. The main supported remote
URL protocols are 'HTTP', 'HTTPS' (with SSL support compiled in) and 'FTP'.
Additional  protocol  support  exists for 'finger', 'Gopher', 'SMB' and
'NNTP'.

OPTIONS
-------

Most options can be set in the user interface or config file, so usually you
do not need to care about them. Note that this list is by no means complete
and it is not kept up-to-date. To get complete list of commandline options,
start 'ELinks' with parameter `--help`.
