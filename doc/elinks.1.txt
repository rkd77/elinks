:Description:	The Elinks text-browser

NAME
----
elinks - lynx-like alternative character mode WWW browser

SYNOPSIS
--------
'elinks' [OPTION]... [URL]...

DESCRIPTION
-----------

'ELinks' is a text mode WWW browser, supporting colors, table rendering,
background downloading, menu driven configuration interface, tabbed browsing
and slim code. 

Frames are supported. You can have different file formats associated with
external viewers. `mailto:` and `telnet:` are supported via external clients.

ELinks  can handle both local files and remote URLs. The main supported remote
URL protocols are 'HTTP', 'HTTPS' (with SSL support compiled in) and 'FTP'.
Additional  protocol  support  exists for 'BitTorrent' 'finger', 'Gopher',
'SMB' and 'NNTP'.

The homepage of 'ELinks' can be found at http://elinks.cz/[], where the ELinks
manual is also hosted.

OPTIONS
-------

Most options can be set in the user interface or config file, so usually you
do not need to care about them. Note that this list is roughly equivalent to
the output of running ELinks with the option `--long-help`.
