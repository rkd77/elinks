We could add also support for:

* cryptlib (http://www.cs.auckland.ac.nz/~pgut001/cryptlib/ - it is distributed
 in zip form which doesn't look very business-like, and it lacks manual in a
 format conviently readable for me; however, they say it is damn fast and very
 easy to use)

* NSS (http://www.mozilla.org/projects/security/pki/nss/ - it could be pretty
 widespread and nicely tested by mozilla, however it scares me, it looks to be
 pretty complex and already needing some certificates db generated etc)

Possibly, we should drop support for native GnuTLS and use their OpenSSL
wrapper instead, since I happen to feel very unsure about GnuTLS interface -
OpenSSL is not much better, but we can steal code from other applications ;-).

We should get some certificates managment and mainly _serious_ and _reliable_
verification of peers' certificates, including URN checking etc etc. We have
serious problems with this and I'm not going to learn real OpenSSL (from
nowhere as I didn't find any usable documentation for OpenSSL) just to fix
this, sorry; someone else must do this.
