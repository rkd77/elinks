/** Whether an assertion has failed and the failure has not yet been handled.
 * To make recovery path possible (assertion failed may not mean end of the
 * world, the execution goes on if we're outside of CONFIG_DEBUG and CONFIG_FASTMEM),
 * @c assert_failed is set to true if the last assert() failed, otherwise it's
 * zero. Note that you must never change assert_failed value, sorry guys.
 *
 * You should never test @c assert_failed directly anyway. Use ::if_assert_failed
 * instead, it will attempt to hint compiler to optimize out the recovery path
 * if we're CONFIG_FASTMEM. So it should go like:
 *
 * @code
 * assertm(1 == 1, "The world's gonna blow up!");
 * if_assert_failed { schedule_time_machine(); return; }
 * @endcode
 *
 * In-depth explanation: this restriction is here because in the CONFIG_FASTMEM mode,
 * @c assert_failed is initially initialized to zero and then not ever touched
 * anymore. So if you change it to non-zero failure, your all further recovery
 * paths will get hit (and since developers usually don't test CONFIG_FASTMEM mode
 * extensively...). So better don't mess with it, even if you would do that
 * with awareness of this fact. We don't want to iterate over tens of spots all
 * over the code when we change one detail regarding CONFIG_FASTMEM operation.
 *
 * This is not that actual after introduction of ::if_assert_failed, but it's
 * a safe recommendation anyway, so... ;-) */
