TODO list
=========

The ELinks TODO items are kept in GitHub <https://github.com/rkd77/elinks>;
look for the bugs with 'enhancement' severity. More general goals are
still kept here, though, to be more visible to developers. ;-) Finally,
the code contains several (greppable) "FIXME" and "TODO" notes regarding
smaller fixes and enhancements.

General goals:

 - Rewrite HTML parser (see the SGML+DOM stuff: src/dom/ & src/document/dom)

 - Write more documentation; docs, a lot of docs!

 - General code cleanup

 - Speed/memory optimizations
