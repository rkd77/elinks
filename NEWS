Release info
============

You can see the complete list of recent changes, bugfixes and new features
in the http://repo.or.cz/w/elinks.git[gitweb interface]. See the ChangeLog
file for details.

ELinks 0.12pre5:
----------------

* Debian bug 534835: Check the return values of some SpiderMonkey
  functions, to avoid crashes if out of memory.
* minor bug 1017: To work around HTTP server bugs, disable
  protocol.http.compression by default, until ELinks can report
  decompression errors or automatically retry the connection.
* enhancement: The French translation was updated.

Bugs that should be removed from NEWS before the 0.12.0 release:

* critical bug 1081: To fix crashes caused by different definitions of
  regfree() in TRE and in the system libc, link with TRE before any
  other libraries.  ELinks 0.12pre4 was the first release that had
  this bug.
* Searching for more than one fullwidth (e.g. Japanese) character now
  works.
* bug 1080: Support ``--dump-color-mode'' with ``--dump-charset UTF-8''.
  Neither of those worked before ELinks 0.12pre1.

ELinks 0.12pre4:
----------------

Released on 2009-05-31.  This release also included the changes listed
under ``ELinks 0.11.6'' below.

Incompatibilities:

* Debian build bug 529821: Use ``pkg-config gnutls'' instead of
  ``libgnutls-config'', which is not included in GNUTLS 2.7.x.
  You can no longer specify the location of GNUTLS using
  ``configure --with-gnutls=DIR''.

Other changes:

* critical bug 1077: Fix crash opening a ``javascript:'' link in a new
  tab.
* Debian bug 528661: If using GNUTLS 2.1.7 or later, disable various
  TLS extensions (including CERT and SERVERNAME) to help handshaking
  with the SSLv3-only bugzilla.novell.com.
* Debian build bug 526349: Include asciidoc.py from AsciiDoc 7.1.2,
  to remove all dependencies on the installed version.
* build enhancement: Recognize ``configure --without-tre''.

Bugs that should be removed from NEWS before the 0.12.0 release:

* critical bug 1071: Fix crash in get_dom_node_child.  ELinks 0.12pre1
  was the first release that had this bug.
* bug 765: Opening a new tab no longer asks about the document of the
  previous tab.  ELinks 0.12pre1 was the first release that had this
  bug.

ELinks 0.12pre3:
----------------

Released on 2009-03-29.  This release also included the changes listed
under ``ELinks 0.11.6'' below.

Incompatibilities:

* bug 1060: Regexp searching now requires the TRE library.
* lzma disabled by default. It's rarely used and doesn't build with new xz.

Other changes:

* critical: Fix assertion failure if IMG/@usemap refers to a different
  file.
* Preserve newlines in hidden input fields, and submit them as CRLF.
  Previously, they could turn into spaces or disappear entirely.
* Perl scripts can use modules that dynamically load C libraries, like
  XML::LibXML::SAX does.
* bug 153: Preserve Unicode characters in XBEL bookmark files.
  However, Unicode in URIs (really IRIs) does not work reliably yet;
  this is being tracked as bug 1066.
* bug 885: Convert xterm titles to ISO-8859-1 by default, but add an
  option to disable this.  When removing control characters from a
  title, note the charset.  Don't truncate titles to the width of the
  terminal.
* bug 1061: Correctly truncate UTF-8 titles in the tab bar.
* bug 1068: ELinks used to display a blank or truncated page if an
  HTTP/1.1 server sent a compressed body with incorrect Content-Length.
  That has now been fixed, and a new option (protocol.http.compression)
  has been added.
* Don't crash when the search-toggle-regex action is used and no regular
  expression support is compiled in.
* minor bug 761: When reading bookmarks from an XBEL file, distinguish
  attribute names from attribute values.
* enhancement: Updated ISO 8859-7, ISO 8859-16, KOI8-R, and MacRoman.

Bugs that should be removed from NEWS before the 0.12.0 release:

* critical bug 1067: Fixed a crash in the RSS parser that ``configure
  --enable-html-highlight'' enables.  ELinks 0.12pre1 was the first
  release that had this bug.
* bug 1069: ELinks didn't report ECMAScript errors, even if the
  ecmascript.error_reporting option was turned on.  ELinks 0.12pre2
  was the first release that had this bug.

ELinks 0.12pre2:
----------------

Released on 2008-09-21.  This release also included the changes listed
under ``ELinks 0.11.5'' below.

* bug 954, enhancement 952: Keep track of ECMAScript form and input
  objects instead of constructing new ones on every access.  When the
  corresponding ELinks internal objects are destroyed, detach the
  ECMAScript objects from them, to prevent crashes.  (Bug 954 was
  first added in ELinks 0.11.4, and the bug 620 fix in ELinks 0.12pre1
  made crashes more likely.)
* critical bug 1029 in user SMJS: Prefer JS_CallFunctionValue over
  JS_CallFunction, which can crash if given a closure.
* critical bug 1031: Use the same JSRuntime for both user SMJS and
  scripts on web pages, to work around SpiderMonkey bug 378918.
* bug 1013: Don't assume errno values are between 0 and 100000.
* bug 1022: Add connection.ssl.trusted_ca_file setting for GnuTLS.
  Before this, ELinks did not trust any certificate authorities when
  it used GnuTLS, so certificate verification always failed if you
  enabled it at connection.ssl.cert_verify.
* bug 1040: Blacklist servers that don't support TLS.  This reduces
  SSL errors especially in HTTP POST requests using GnuTLS.
* bugs 1007, 1041: Display unrecognized lines in FTP directory
  listings, instead of annoying the user with error messages.
* Hurd bug 22861: Work around select() falsely reporting exceptions
  in pipes.
* minor bug 951: SpiderMonkey scripting objects used to prevent ELinks
  from removing files from the memory cache.
* build bug 1044: Check whether -rdynamic works with libraries.
  With Sun Studio 11 on Solaris 9, it reportedly doesn't.

Bugs that should be removed from NEWS before the 0.12.0 release:

* critical: Fix crash after a tab was opened during reload.  This was
  triggered by the bug 620 fix in ELinks 0.12pre1.
* critical bug 1018: Avoid an assertion failure when selecting a value
  from a pop-up menu for an input field in a tab that is no longer
  current, e.g. because another tab was opened with elinks -remote.
  This bug was first released in ELinks 0.12pre1.
* major bug 1026 in user SMJS: Protect the callback of elinks.load_uri
  from the garbage collector.  The elinks.load_uri method was added in
  ELinks 0.12pre1.
* bug 955: Reset buttons no longer run FORM/@onsubmit, and
  ``harmless'' buttons no longer submit the form.  ELinks 0.12pre1
  was the first release that had these bugs.
* bug 1033: Fix memory leak in ECMAScript window.open.  ELinks 0.12pre1
  was the first release that had this bug.
* bug 1034: ``Content-Encoding: deflate'' allows a zlib header as
  specified in RFC 2616.
* Global ECMAScript functions alert, open, and setTimeout again work
  with SEE.  ELinks 0.12pre1 was the first release that supported SEE
  at all.
* build bug 1045: Fix ``void function cannot return value'' in
  never_for_this_site() of src/formhist/formhist.c.  ELinks 0.12pre1
  was the first release that had this bug.

ELinks 0.12pre1:
----------------

Released on 2008-07-01.  This release also included the changes listed
under ``ELinks 0.11.4'' below.

Notable new features:

* enhancement 822: UTF-8 as terminal charset, not merely UTF-8 I/O
  of a unibyte codepage as in previous versions.  Double-cell (aka
  fullwidth) and supplementary characters work too, but combining
  characters and right-to-left text do not.  The only multibyte
  charset ELinks can decode is still UTF-8, so if the server outputs
  e.g. Shift-JIS, you'd better recode with a proxy.  See more notes
  in features.conf.
* enhancement 844: SMB protocol using libsmbclient.  This replaces
  the smbclient-based code that was disabled in ELinks 0.11.2.
  Unfortunately, Samba 3.2.0 and later seem GPLv2 incompatible.

Incompatibilities:

* ECMAScript support is now disabled by default.  It has known
  bugs 548 and 771 with which malicious web pages can hang ELinks,
  and its security goals are undocumented.  If you must enable
  ECMAScript support, it would be prudent to restrict the ELinks
  process with a sandbox of some kind.
* ECMAScript support no longer works with SpiderMonkey versions
  earlier than JS1.5 RC3a.
* Gzip decompression support now requires zlib 1.2.0.2 or later.
* bugs 871, 752: The numbering of terminal.*.colors no longer depends
  on config options.  This change makes elinks.conf portable between
  different configurations but unfortunately not between this and
  previous versions.
* Changed Python goto_url_hook(current) to goto_url_hook(new).  The
  hook can call the new function elinks.current_url() if desired.
  The Python scripting back-end is much more featureful than in
  previous releases, but it is still considered experimental.
* Guile scripting reads hooks.scm rather than internal-hooks.scm.
  (It still reads user-hooks.scm, too.)

Miscellaneous:

* critical bug 723: fix dangling pointer crash when following a link
  in a frame
* critical bug 756: ``assertion (cached)->object.refcount >= 0 failed''
  after HTTP proxy was changed
* critical bug 869: long mailcap entry buffer overflow (non-security)
  when downloading
* tabs opened by -remote now go behind existing dialogs
* major bug 534, enhancement 517: fix HTTP gzip and bzip2
  decompression, and add deflate and LZMA (requires LZMA Utils)
* major bug 503: various fixes in parsing and updating of elinks.conf
* Debian bug 257762: turn terminal transparency off by default
* bug 770: when the user chooses to resume an HTTP download, abort the
  automatically started one and start a new one with the right range
* bug 724: better parsing of escape sequences and control
  sequences from the terminal
* bug 948: fix wrong UTF-8 output after the charset menu was used
* bug 816: convert entity references in input/@value only once
* bug 916: if a mailcap entry has no %s, provide the file as stdin
* bug 744: don't change ``//'' to ``/'' in URIs
* bug 766: speed up CSS
* bug 355: add documents displayed via ``What to do'' dialog to the
  global history
* encode and decode filenames in FSP URLs
* don't use a busy cache entry if it has expired or should be
  reloaded.  See elinks-users mail from 28 Oct 2005.
* several accesskey fixes
* in Lua: don't write to the string returned by lua_tostring
* minor bug 972: preserve the background color and underlining in
  spaces when justifying
* minor bug 284: render closing bracket for HTML element SUB in the
  same line; don't let it fall to the next

* enhancement: support Ctrl+Alt+letter key combinations
* enhancement 381: reduce memory consumption of codepages and some
  other arrays
* enhancement in user SMJS: new properties/functions elinks.action,
  elinks.execute, elinks.globhist, elinks.load_uri, elinks.vs

  statements work as intended
* fix error ``forms.namedItem is not a function''

* enhancement: handling onsubmit
* workaround: window.open remembers the last few URLs and doesn't
  reopen them when incremental rendering reruns the onload script
