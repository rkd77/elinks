with SpiderMonkey, we won't go far.

As you might notice, I renamed repo to elinks.

Thanks to all involved in this release.

ELinks 0.13.1:
--------------

Released on 2020-01-31.

* Fixed issue with uploading files to local cgi.
* Python scripts in contrib converted to python3.

ELinks 0.13.0:
--------------

Released on 2019-12-27.

Incompatibilities:

* The protocol.fsp.sort option has been removed.  ELinks always sorts.
* bug 1024: Verify the host name or IP address in the server certificate
  if connection.ssl.cert_verify is not 0.

Miscellaneous:

* The configure script is no longer part of tarball, you must generate it.
  For example running ./autogen.sh
* major bug 181: Slave ELinks processes can now run an external editor.
  This used to work in the master process only.
* major bug 722: Filter CSS according to media types.  New option
  document.css.media.
* bug 638: Propagate the existence of $DISPLAY from slave terminals to
  mailcap test commands.
* bugs 762, 1082: Small memory leak in goto_current_link/goto_imgmap
* bug 963: New option document.css.ignore_display_none.
* bug 977: Fixed crash when opening in new tab a non link with onclick
  attribute.
* bug 1008: File upload fields in HTML forms now stream the files to
  the server, instead of reading them to memory in advance.  This lets
  you upload larger files.  The downsides are that ELinks may use a
  cached response even if you have modified a file between requests,
  and that ELinks can send inconsistent data if you modify a file
  while it is being uploaded.
* bug 1054: Don't abort downloads when closing the terminal from which
  they were started.  When such a download ends, display the message
  in the most recently used terminal.  If the user chooses
  ``Background and Notify'' via the download manager in some terminal,
  reassociate the download with that terminal.  These changes do not
  apply to downloads to external handlers.
* Really retry forever when connection.retries = 0.
* enhancement: Session-specific options.  Any options changed with
  toggle-* actions no longer affect other tabs or other terminals.
* Do not crash when document.browse.minimum_refresh_time = 0 and
  a document has a meta refresh with a delay of 0.
* Properly update link highlighting and status bar information when the
  repeat prefix is changed.
* Handle SSL rehandshakes
* Fix compatibility with Ruby >= 1.9
* enhancement 15: Domain-specific options.  Use set_domain in
  elinks.conf to e.g. disable cookies for google.com.  The option
  manager window does not yet support this.
* enhancement 867: Use bracketed paste mode on xterm.  This requires
  xterm patch #228 or later configured with --enable-readline-mouse.
* enhancement 824: Experimental support for combining characters.
  See features.conf for details.
* enhancement: Add a new entry Link Info under Link main menu.
* enhancement: Indicate backgrounded downloads using an unused led.
* enhancement: Display the number of ECMAScript interpreters that have
  been allocated for documents in the Resources dialog.
* Fedora enhancement 346861: Add support for nss_compat_ossl library
  (OpenSSL replacement).
* enhancement: ``elinks --dump'' uses box-drawing characters if supported
  by the charset.
* enhancement 1070: Support 256 colors on fbterm-1.4.
* enhancement 1075: Scrolling the entire contents of dialog boxes.
  Especially useful for multi-file BitTorrent downloads.
* Report if the Lua function edit_bookmark_dialog receives the wrong
  number or types of arguments instead of silently failing.
* enhancement: Add ``Invalidate'' button to the cache manager.
* enhancement: Add ``Search contents'' button to the cache manager with
  which one can search through the cache items' data rather than their
  metadata.
* enhancement: Add rudimentary support for the HTML5 media elements,
  <video> and <audio>.
* enhancement: Add move-half-page-up and move-half-page-down actions.
* enhancement: Add option to change overlap for vertical scrolling.
* enhancement: HTML meta refresh allows semicolons in URLs, and the
  syntax is more like in Firefox.
* link against lua51 not lua50
* SpiderMonkey must be mozjs-17.0. This version is latest with C API.
  Find it with pkg-config.
* using iconv for some multibyte charsets. It works if the terminal codepage
  is UTF-8. More charsets will be added on demand.
* enhancement: support SSL client certificate
* python scripting is Python3 only
* brotli and zstd encodings
* possibility to make use of libevent instead of select for event loop
* terminfo queries for output (not input) as compilation option

ELinks 0.12pre6
---------------

Released on 2012-10-30.

Security fix:

* bug 1124, CVE-2012-4545: Do not delegate GSSAPI credentials in HTTP
  Negotiate or GSS-Negotiate authentication.  Reported by Marko Myllynen.
  (ELinks 0.12pre1 was the first release that supported GSSAPI; earlier
  releases are not vulnerable.)

Fixed crashes and hangs:

* critical bug 943: Don't let user JavaScripts call any methods of
  ``elinks.action'' in tabs that do not have the focus.  If a tab was
  closed with ``elinks.action.tab_close'' while it had pop-up windows,
  ELinks could crash; as a precaution, don't allow other actions
  either.  (ELinks 0.12pre1 was the first release that supported
  ``elinks.action''.)
* critical bug 1083: Avoid an infinite loop when trying to decompress
  malformed data.  Caused by the bug 1068 fix in ELinks 0.12pre3.
* Fix a possible crash or information disclosure on big-endian 64-bit
  systems using HTTP Negotiate or GSS-Negotiate authentication.

Incompatibilities:

* Dropped support for SEE.  (ELinks 0.12pre1 was the first release
  that supported SEE.)
* Guile 2.0.0 (released on 2011-02-16) changed its license to
  LGPLv3-or-later, which is not compatible with the GPLv2 that covers
  ELinks.  Also, Guile has deprecated many of the functions that
  ELinks calls.

Other changes:

* major bug 764: Correctly initialize options on big-endian 64-bit
  systems.
* bug 983: Give preference to the Content-Type specified in the HTTP
  header over that specified via the HTML meta tag.
* bug 1084: Allow option names containing '+' and '*' in the option
  manager.
* bug 1112: Map most numeric character references &#x80; ... &#x9F;
  to graphical characters also when the output charset is UTF-8.
  (ELinks 0.12pre1 was the first release that supported UTF-8 as the
  terminal charset, and ELinks 0.12pre5 was the first release that
  supported UTF-8 as the dump charset.)
* minor bug 1113: Fix a small memory leak if a mailcap file is malformed.
* minor bug 1114: Decode SGML entities and NCRs only once in link/@title
  and other attributes.
* build: Fix several warnings reported by GCC 4.7.1.  Harmless at
  runtime but could break the build if configured --enable-debug.
  (This version does not fix all such warnings.)

ELinks 0.12pre5:
----------------

Released on 2009-07-08.

* Debian bug 534835: Check the return values of some SpiderMonkey
  functions, to avoid crashes if out of memory.
* minor bug 1017: To work around HTTP server bugs, disable
  protocol.http.compression by default, until ELinks can report
  decompression errors or automatically retry the connection.
* enhancement: The French translation was updated.

Bugs that should be removed from NEWS before the 0.12.0 release:

* critical bug 1081: To fix crashes caused by different definitions of
  regfree() in TRE and in the system libc, link with TRE before any
  other libraries.  ELinks 0.12pre4 was the first release that had
  this bug.
* Searching for more than one fullwidth (e.g. Japanese) character now
  works.
* bug 1080: Support ``--dump-color-mode'' with ``--dump-charset UTF-8''.
  Neither of those worked before ELinks 0.12pre1.

ELinks 0.12pre4:
----------------

Released on 2009-05-31.

Incompatibilities:

* Debian build bug 529821: Use ``pkg-config gnutls'' instead of
  ``libgnutls-config'', which is not included in GNUTLS 2.7.x.
  You can no longer specify the location of GNUTLS using
  ``configure --with-gnutls=DIR''.

Other changes:

* critical bug 1077: Fix crash opening a ``javascript:'' link in a new
  tab.
* Debian bug 528661: If using GNUTLS 2.1.7 or later, disable various
  TLS extensions (including CERT and SERVERNAME) to help handshaking
  with the SSLv3-only bugzilla.novell.com.
* Debian build bug 526349: Include asciidoc.py from AsciiDoc 7.1.2,
  to remove all dependencies on the installed version.
* build enhancement: Recognize ``configure --without-tre''.

Bugs that should be removed from NEWS before the 0.12.0 release:

* critical bug 1071: Fix crash in get_dom_node_child.  ELinks 0.12pre1
  was the first release that had this bug.
* bug 765: Opening a new tab no longer asks about the document of the
  previous tab.  ELinks 0.12pre1 was the first release that had this
  bug.

ELinks 0.12pre3:
----------------

Released on 2009-03-29.  This release also included the changes listed
under ``ELinks 0.11.6'' below.

Incompatibilities:

* bug 1060: Regexp searching now requires the TRE library.
* lzma disabled by default. It's rarely used and doesn't build with new xz.

Other changes:

* critical: Fix assertion failure if IMG/@usemap refers to a different
  file.
* Preserve newlines in hidden input fields, and submit them as CRLF.
  Previously, they could turn into spaces or disappear entirely.
* Perl scripts can use modules that dynamically load C libraries, like
  XML::LibXML::SAX does.
* bug 153: Preserve Unicode characters in XBEL bookmark files.
  However, Unicode in URIs (really IRIs) does not work reliably yet;
  this is being tracked as bug 1066.
* bug 885: Convert xterm titles to ISO-8859-1 by default, but add an
  option to disable this.  When removing control characters from a
  title, note the charset.  Don't truncate titles to the width of the
  terminal.
* bug 1061: Correctly truncate UTF-8 titles in the tab bar.
* bug 1068: ELinks used to display a blank or truncated page if an
  HTTP/1.1 server sent a compressed body with incorrect Content-Length.
  That has now been fixed, and a new option (protocol.http.compression)
  has been added.
* Don't crash when the search-toggle-regex action is used and no regular
  expression support is compiled in.
* minor bug 761: When reading bookmarks from an XBEL file, distinguish
  attribute names from attribute values.
* enhancement: Updated ISO 8859-7, ISO 8859-16, KOI8-R, and MacRoman.

Bugs that should be removed from NEWS before the 0.12.0 release:

* critical bug 1067: Fixed a crash in the RSS parser that ``configure
  --enable-html-highlight'' enables.  ELinks 0.12pre1 was the first
  release that had this bug.
* bug 1069: ELinks didn't report ECMAScript errors, even if the
  ecmascript.error_reporting option was turned on.  ELinks 0.12pre2
  was the first release that had this bug.

ELinks 0.12pre2:
----------------

Released on 2008-09-21.  This release also included the changes listed
under ``ELinks 0.11.5'' below.

* bug 954, enhancement 952: Keep track of ECMAScript form and input
  objects instead of constructing new ones on every access.  When the
  corresponding ELinks internal objects are destroyed, detach the
  ECMAScript objects from them, to prevent crashes.  (Bug 954 was
  first added in ELinks 0.11.4, and the bug 620 fix in ELinks 0.12pre1
  made crashes more likely.)
* critical bug 1029 in user SMJS: Prefer JS_CallFunctionValue over
  JS_CallFunction, which can crash if given a closure.
* critical bug 1031: Use the same JSRuntime for both user SMJS and
  scripts on web pages, to work around SpiderMonkey bug 378918.
* bug 1013: Don't assume errno values are between 0 and 100000.
* bug 1022: Add connection.ssl.trusted_ca_file setting for GnuTLS.
  Before this, ELinks did not trust any certificate authorities when
  it used GnuTLS, so certificate verification always failed if you
  enabled it at connection.ssl.cert_verify.
* bug 1040: Blacklist servers that don't support TLS.  This reduces
  SSL errors especially in HTTP POST requests using GnuTLS.
* bugs 1007, 1041: Display unrecognized lines in FTP directory
  listings, instead of annoying the user with error messages.
* Hurd bug 22861: Work around select() falsely reporting exceptions
  in pipes.
* minor bug 951: SpiderMonkey scripting objects used to prevent ELinks
  from removing files from the memory cache.
* build bug 1044: Check whether -rdynamic works with libraries.
  With Sun Studio 11 on Solaris 9, it reportedly doesn't.

Bugs that should be removed from NEWS before the 0.12.0 release:

* critical: Fix crash after a tab was opened during reload.  This was
  triggered by the bug 620 fix in ELinks 0.12pre1.
* critical bug 1018: Avoid an assertion failure when selecting a value
  from a pop-up menu for an input field in a tab that is no longer
  current, e.g. because another tab was opened with elinks -remote.
  This bug was first released in ELinks 0.12pre1.
* major bug 1026 in user SMJS: Protect the callback of elinks.load_uri
  from the garbage collector.  The elinks.load_uri method was added in
  ELinks 0.12pre1.
* bug 955: Reset buttons no longer run FORM/@onsubmit, and
  ``harmless'' buttons no longer submit the form.  ELinks 0.12pre1
  was the first release that had these bugs.
* bug 1033: Fix memory leak in ECMAScript window.open.  ELinks 0.12pre1
  was the first release that had this bug.
* bug 1034: ``Content-Encoding: deflate'' allows a zlib header as
  specified in RFC 2616.
* Global ECMAScript functions alert, open, and setTimeout again work
  with SEE.  ELinks 0.12pre1 was the first release that supported SEE
  at all.
* build bug 1045: Fix ``void function cannot return value'' in
  never_for_this_site() of src/formhist/formhist.c.  ELinks 0.12pre1
  was the first release that had this bug.

ELinks 0.12pre1:
----------------

Released on 2008-07-01.  This release also included the changes listed
under ``ELinks 0.11.4'' below.

Notable new features:

* enhancement 822: UTF-8 as terminal charset, not merely UTF-8 I/O
  of a unibyte codepage as in previous versions.  Double-cell (aka
  fullwidth) and supplementary characters work too, but combining
  characters and right-to-left text do not.  The only multibyte
  charset ELinks can decode is still UTF-8, so if the server outputs
  e.g. Shift-JIS, you'd better recode with a proxy.  See more notes
  in features.conf.
* enhancement 844: SMB protocol using libsmbclient.  This replaces
  the smbclient-based code that was disabled in ELinks 0.11.2.
  Unfortunately, Samba 3.2.0 and later seem GPLv2 incompatible.

Incompatibilities:

* ECMAScript support is now disabled by default.  It has known
  bugs 548 and 771 with which malicious web pages can hang ELinks,
  and its security goals are undocumented.  If you must enable
  ECMAScript support, it would be prudent to restrict the ELinks
  process with a sandbox of some kind.
* ECMAScript support no longer works with SpiderMonkey versions
  earlier than JS1.5 RC3a.
* Gzip decompression support now requires zlib 1.2.0.2 or later.

  previous versions.

  hook can call the new function elinks.current_url() if desired.
  The Python scripting back-end is much more featureful than in
  previous releases, but it is still considered experimental.
* Guile scripting reads hooks.scm rather than internal-hooks.scm.
  (It still reads user-hooks.scm, too.)
