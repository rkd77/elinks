Elinks installation guidelines
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

  Quick guide for the impatient:

	./configure && make && make install

  Check out the bottom of this file if you're upgrading from Links or an older
ELinks! And be sure to look at doc/ecmascript.txt if you want (experimental)
ECMAScript (that's JavaScript) support.

##########

  In order to check out the latest tree from CVS:

$ export CVSROOT=check_file_SITES_for_value_of_this
$ cvs login
(empty password)
$ cvs -z3 co elinks
$ cd elinks
...

  To update your existing tree to the latest CVS version, do:

$ cvs -z3 update -dP

  If you downloaded a nightly snapshot, it already contains CVS/ directories
etc.  Thus, you should be able to update your tree with the above command as if
you had previously done a full cvs checkout.

  Note that if you obtained the sources directly from CVS, you NEED to run
./autogen.sh!  (It should be enough to do it once, automake should be smart
enough to rerun itself when needed - however, if you have build problems, try
running this first.)  Also, you obviously need automake and autoconf installed
on your system (note that autoconf-2.13 a automake-1.4p5 are supported, newer
ones may cause problems thanks to the auto* developers who don't know how to
maintain backwards compatibility).  Otherwise, you have to use the nightly CVS
snapshot - you don't need to do this there.


##########

  If you want to compile ELinks, first check the directory named contrib/, it
may contain patches that are of use to you.  If you're interested in any of
them, try to apply them by doing (for each one):

$ patch -p0 < contrib/that-patch

  They may not apply, since I don't update patches in contrib/ regularly - if
you want, feel free to go ahead and update the patch for the current tree and
submit the newer version.

  Usually, even after strip, the ELinks binary can measure a lot, but you can
radically reduce the resulting binary size by throwing out stuff you don't like.
Detailed discussion of reducing the executable size can be found in

	doc/small.txt

  !BEWARE!  If you _distribute_ a binary of ELinks with OpenSSL linked to it,
and the OpenSSL library is not part of your base system, you are VIOLATING THE
GPL (although I believe that for this absurd case no ELinks copyright holder
will sue you, and it's not a problem for the OpenSSL people as well, as they
have explicitly told me).  So, people who are making ELinks binaries for systems
with no OpenSSL in the base system and who decided to link OpenSSL against the
ELinks binary may wish NOT to publish or distribute such a binary, as it's
breaking GPL 2(b), if they like to have everything legally perfect (like Debian
people ;).  As a semi-solution to this for those people, GNUTLS support was
introduced; if you want to distribute ELinks binaries with HTTPS support,
compile ELinks with the --with-gnutls configure option (assuming that you have
GNUTLS 0.5.0 or later [tested with 0.5.4] installed).  However, as GNUTLS is not
yet 100% stable and its support in ELinks is not so well tested yet, it's
recommended for users to give a strong preference to OpenSSL whenever possible.

  Good luck!

  The compilation itself looks like:

  Unix - just doing:

	 $ ./configure
	 $ make

	 should be enough.  However, in some FreeBSD 3 distributions you have to
	 set CFLAGS=-aout before running ./configure.  Also, you may want to
	 adjust some (well, plenty of) compile-time options through ./configure
	 - do ./configure --help and it'll print out a list of them. You can
	 finetune what's going to be included in the binary in the features.conf
	 file, and some really detailed tuning can be performed in src/setup.h.

	 Also, a nice idea is to compile ELinks outside of the source tree (note
	 that this might not quite work right now, but we're working on fixing
	 it). Make another directory and run path_to_source_tree/configure from
	 it. Typically, it looks like:

	 $ mkdir ../elinks-build
	 $ cd ../elinks-build
	 $ ../elinks/configure
	 $ make

  OS/2 - you can use ./configure.

	 The only supported compiler is EMX, you probably won't be able to
	 compile it with anything else.

	 Configure under OS/2 needs to know paths to gcc, make and bash.
	 Set (for example):

	 SET HOSTTYPE=i586
	 SET MACHTYPE=i586-pc-os2
	 SET CONFIG_SHELL=d:/prg/gnu/bin/bash.exe
	 SET CC=d:/prg/emx/bin/gcc.exe
	 SET MAKE=d:/prg/emx/bin/make.exe
	 SET EMXOPT=-h100

  DOS, Windows - port it by yourself.


##########

  Ok, now let's install it:

  Unix - # make install

  OS/2 -
	Copy file links.exe somewhere to your path or create CMD file that runs
	links.

	 WARNING: EMX has a nasty limit on open files.  Links will work badly or
	 won't work with the default settings.  Set the variable EMXOPT=-h100
	 before you run links.

  Now, check the contrib/ directory again.  There may be some useful config
file examples there, along with few support tools and some Lua scripts - you
probably want them ;) so just copy hooks.lua to ~/.elinks, and edit the
configuration part - it adds various functionality to ELinks, like
decompression of gzipped files or HTML code rewriting for ELinks-unfriendly
websites.


##########

  If you're upgrading from Links or older ELinks (0.4pre7 or older), you will
notice that several things have changed.  First, the binary name is elinks, not
links, now; however, the basic usage is almost the same and it still looks like
the old (E)Links, so you probably want to make a links symlink pointing to
elinks.

  Then, note that configuration files were moved from /etc to /etc/elinks and
from ~/.links to ~/.elinks, because the name and format of some of them was
changed:

  links.cfg became elinks.conf and you need to convert it with
contrib/conv/conf-links2elinks.pl; html.cfg was merged into elinks.conf.

  bookmarks are still bookmarks, but you need to convert it with
old_to_new_bookmarks.sh.

  links.his became gotohist and the format is the same.

  history became globhist and the format is the same.

  cookies are still cookies, but you need to convert it with tr " " "\t".
